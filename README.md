ABOUT OUR APPLICATION:

## Inspiration

As aspiring computer scientists, we spend no small amount of time sitting in front of a computer. Digital media is our bread and butter- as such, we decided to develop something that we would personally find useful in our lives as university students. We landed on Suggestify after much deliberation, but we agreed that all of us were running out of music to listen to and shows to watch during the quarantine. We are a team of individuals with mixed experience, two members with experience in web development and two members who are very new. As a result, the project was a teaching experience for everyone involved.

## What it does 

Suggestify is a web-based implementation of an app that serves as a sort of personalized dashboard that utilizes the power of Machine Learning in order to recommend a song/show for the user based on a simple quiz. Ideally, our site would collect user input in the form of quiz answers, and from that dataset, apply the ML algorithms in order to extrapolate and predict what kind of content the user wants to see/hea

## How we built it 

Using a mixture of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and an amalgam of APIs, we each got to work on our tasks. We divided the work into frontend/backend and got to work on each individual aspect of the project. The site manifested from a purely speculative endeavor into a real, tangible product all thanks to the tireless efforts of our team. Through a mix of brainstorming and sheer willpower, we managed to create something that resembled what we originally wanted.

## Challenges we ran into

Actually making sure that all the moving pieces fit together was a considerable challenge that we certainly were not expecting when starting the project. We were met with unforeseeable roadblocks at every step of the way but were able to rely on each other for guidance as well as a helping hand. On top of that, the UI proved to be rather finicky along the way since certain elements did not work well with others. (I'm looking at you, immovable stars!)

## What we learned

Speaking as someone who had very little experience with web-development before this project, I feel like I am horizons beyond where I was just a few days ago in terms of progress. Actually applying the knowledge from tutorials was far more effective at teaching than just watching those videos themselves.

## What's next for Suggestify 

There wasn't quite enough time to implement the show/movie suggestions quiz and prediction algorithm, but we've got high hopes for the future- when we plan to implement this feature and hopefully start to test it and iron out the wrinkles.
